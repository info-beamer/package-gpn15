= GPN 15 conference

This is mostly the code that was running at the GPN 15 conference (https://entropia.de/GPN15).
It was cleaned up after the conference and made better. Now you can properly reload and change
modules while the visualization is running. I didn't port over all modules, but the missing
modules (show child nodes, etc) should be easy to add.
